				<h1> Who am I?</h1>
				<p id="who">I am <i><b>Caryl Angela Catapang Opulencia,</b></i> a Philippine Science High School Scholar. Knowing I am a PISAY scholar, you might be thinking that "Ah she's intelligent for sure.
							She's a nerd! She knows nothing about sport. She might be gifted! She does nothing but study. She's arrogant for sure. Certainly, she is going to be successful." I have received such 
							assumptions like these for many times that I have gotten used to it. I am just a typical highschool student with dreams. And having discussed what intelligence truly is, of course,
							I consider myself as intelligent too. During elementary, my teacher would praise me and students would idolize me because thay believe that I have it all: the "beauty, brains, leadership 
							and	atheletic body". They say I am multi-intelligent the so called "jack of all trades" but I honestly still feel insecure of other people. And yes I maybe a Jack of All Trades but Master
							of none. I feel like I don't really have any talent. I mean I can dance, but my body is not as graceful as others'. They I've got a nice voice but I tend to be off-tuned most of the time.
							I can play guitar too but just the basics. I can draw and paint as well but I don't have any art style. Does that mean I am actually just an average? a mediocre?. <i><b>(Hover on the images below 
							to get to know me more.)</i></b></p>

      							<p> I am a consistent honor student ever since pre-elem. I graduated elementary as the class valedictorian and with high hnors. Now in PISAY, I am a consitent director's lister from freshman year 'til now. Does that mean I am intelligent? Well, it could be. 
							I learn and understand things faster compared to others and I must I am creative too. I love making crafts and artworks. So, I must really be intelligent.</p>

      							<p> From pre-school to elementary, I have joined several pageants. I would be the classroom muse or representative every year. Outside the school I joined this Barangay-wide beauty contest. I won first runner up and some speacial awards excluding the "Best
							in Talent". I remember that my talent was a short skit, the fisrt part I perform some karate and taekwondo exhibitions, then dance, then act and cry, and lastly sing. I almost did everything but still did not won the contest. Otherwise, I had fun and realized that I could really do lots of things.</p>

      							<p> To be physically fit and active and to learn how to defend ourselves, dad enrolled us in Taekwondo class as early as 6 years old for two consecutive summer vacations. When I was in grade 3, dad decided to move us to karate instead because it is more practical 
							and makes use of hands and arms more unlike taekwondo that is mostly kicking. Unfortunately, we had to stop because kuya got his wrist fractured during a match/sparring. The next vacation to that, I participate in an arnis class and really had fun. Dad also enrolled us to 
							a swimming lesson and there I was able to conquer my fear of water. Being athletic and sporty runs in our blood ever since. Mom was an athlete, a sprinter to be specific which Kuya and I inherit.</p>

This is to remind me that I shouldn't mind and care about what the society think of me for the only thing that matters is how I perceive myself to be.
					I know I am amazing, I am wonderful, I am blessed, I am beautiful, I am intelligent, I am unique, and I am a God's masterpiece. </p>
