				<h1> How do <span id="gen">society</span> view intelligence?</h1>
				<p id="how"> As time passes by, the society's view on intelligence is starting to develop, improve, and change for the better. However, many people still do think that only people who excel in school, good in math and sciences, and fluent in englsih are the only ones to be considered as intelligent.
							We all have to understand that the concept of intelligence is broad and is actually vague. Found below are the words used by several people to describe others whom they consider beyond average in terms of intelligence. <i><b>(Tap on any word to know meaning.)</b></i></p>

			<div class="society">
				<p>Most of the words listed above are society's connotation when talking about people who seem to be special because of their minds. But what the society fails to understand is that we are all special in our own ways. We are capable of  varying
					things and blessed with different gifts. We should stop invalidating other people's capacities just because they do not seem to fit our bullshit toxic standards. Why bullshit and toxic? Because some people end up not knowing where to place themselves because when you make
					mistakes in grammar or you can't solve a simple polynomial function, you will be labelled as 'bobo', 'mangmang', and 'hindi nag-iisip'. BUT when you corrected someone for their mistakes, or you share some facts and information, you'll be attacked
					by lines: "EDI WOW", "ikaw na magaling", "akala mo kung sino", "oo na ako na bobo", "pabibo". It really just makes no sense at all like as if it was the person's fault that he is thinking, reading, studying, and sharing helpful facts.</p>

				<h1 id="shame">Smart Shaming<br><span id="culture">culture</span></h1>
				<p id="explain">- also known as <i><b>Anti-intellectualism</b></i> is an act of mocking someone who is deemed to be more intellectual than others and insulting them for their display of intellect. These are common responses of Filipinos, yes mostly Filipinos, (because here in the Philippines,
				being intelligent is as if a curse)	to insightful ideas, facts, and knowledge that they don't have any knowledge about. Really, what is to wrong about knowing things? Why is there a need to be ashamed of? Living in a society with the culture of ignorance and hostility to the intellect is just 
				so toxic and problematic. Let us all just stop and accept the fact that we don't know everything and we shall be open for oppurtunities to grow and learn.

				<h1 id="mental">Mental Health Issues</h1>
				<ul id="issues">
					<li>Lowered Self-Esteem
						<p>Due to societal's standards, people mostly students tend to have lower confidence and belief in themselves. They would usually compare themselves with other people who seem to be more fit to the society and would up feeling down. They would
							doubt themselves several times because other people keep on invalidating their talents, telling they are failures and would succeed if they pursue their passion. They would question themselves thinking they are not enough, and they are stupid.</p></li>
					<li>Bullying
						<p>This could happen both to people who are intelligent in terms of the current societal's standards and to those who are labelled as stupid. In a classroom setting, students would be afraid of asking and answering questions for fear of making 
							mistakes, being embarassed, and being laugh at. Most of the time, other students would laugh and bully the other one who made mistake and couldn't answer a simple question. In the other hand, bullying could also be in the form of <a href="#shame">smart shaming.</a> They will be called as nerd,
							book-worm, pabibo, and the likes. In simpler words, bullying happens due to the belief that being different is abnormal when in fact we are all different from each other.</p></li>
					<li>Insecurities
						<p>Insecurity is a tendency of a person to lack confidence or certainty in oneself, may be experienced by most people regarding some aspect of their lives (goodteraphy.org). As discussed above, insecurity is brought by lack of confidence and comparison with others.
							This happen when a person is not contented with himself for the society is telling him that he is not enough and he should be this that.</p></li>
					<li>Depression
						<p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness(psychiatry.org) that causes a persistent felling of sadness and loss of interest(mayoclinic.org). This is actually a medical disorder which people do not usually understand and pay attention to.
							It is due to several factors and some of which are found above (lowered self-esteem, bullying, and insecurities). Patients tend to degrade their self-worth thinking that they are no longer worthy of living.</p></li>
