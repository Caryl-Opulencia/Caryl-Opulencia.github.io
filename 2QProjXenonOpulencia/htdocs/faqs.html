				<h1> What influences<span id="gen">Intelligence?</span></h1>
				<p id="how"> Intelligence is affected by several factors. Even the meal we eat affect the function of our brain (see aside). But the biggest factor to intelligence is one's perception of himself.
							With the belief in oneself, everthing is possible because reality is something we percieved to be true and our perception of ourselves should be someone who we truly deserve. This belief in 
							thyself is usually influenced by the society (see <a href="others.html">others</a>) and we shouldn't let that because no one knows who truly we are except ourselves. Another thing to consider is
							time and dedication. Nobody, even scientists and mathematician are born knowing everything, formulas, theories, etc, They dedicate time and effort in studying, making researches, and practicing. 
							And same thing goes with skills and talents, we must invest time and effort to get better and better each day.<i><b>(Hover the questions to view answers.)</b></i></p>

				<p> What you eat directly affects the structure and function of your brain and, ultimately, your mood. So you might as well limit eating the following foods</p>
				<ul class="keys">
					<li>Sugary drinks - include beverages like soda, sports drinks, energy drinks and fruit juice.</li>
					<li>Refined carbohydrates - include sugars and highly processed grains, such as white flour.</li>
					<li>Trans fats - a type of unsaturated fat that can have a detrimental effect on brain health.</li>
					<li>Highly processed - foods tend to be high in sugar, added fats and salt. Examples are fast foods which are one of our favorites.</li>
					<li>Alcohol - excessive consumption of alcohol is proven to be dangerous on one's health and even on brain. Drink responsibly.</li>
				</ul>

					<p>There is actually no specific standards or assessments to know how intelligent you are for just like what I have mentioned a couple times already, intelligence is in no way similar to height or 
					weight which could easily be measured using standard scales and could be classified as underweight, normal, and obese according to one’s BMI. However, to answer the question, testing intelligence is 
					a lifelong assessment. Intelligence could truly be assessed through dwelling on life quests and challenges and through making a difference in this world.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="answers" id="a2">
					<p><br><br><br>Intellgence is an intangible object. It can't be seen for we can't say that someone is intelligent just by his appearance. It is therefore a concept. An idea that is now used to create discrimintaioon and divide. A concept created by someone who probably wants people to go crazy about competition and self-achievements.</p>			
				</div>
				
				<div class="answers" id="a3">
					<p><br>The first thing to do is have belief and awareness of thyself. He or she shall be aware of his/her strengths and weaknesses. After knowing these, one must focus things/skills they want to get better at.
					To do that he/she shall allot a specific time within a day or week perhaps where he/she could practice, enhance, and hone his/her intelligence.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="answers" id="a4">
					<p><br><br><br><br>YES. If you think you are, then you are!. But if you think otherwise, then might as well try to change your perspective.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="answers" id="a5">
					<p><br>In this trying times, the pandemic and online classes just made 2020 so difficult for students to cope up. In the current output-based education sysytem, students are judged by their ability to pass requirements on time, to stay awake even pass 2am, and to one's adaptability even in this time when what matters most is everyone's well-being. 
					It is necessary to understand varying types of intelligents so other people won't feel stupid and invalidated for not passing a simple exam.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="answers" id="a6">
					<p><br>Some people of my age or younger would sometimes approach me ask how to be me? Well I just want to say that just like everyone else in this world, I am not perfect and I have my flaws and weaknesses too. I ain't got everything and you don't even know me completely. You don't need to be me or to be as good as me for you are you and you are as good as you. 
					Surely, there are things that you can do but I cannot, and vv. and its okay. That is actually our distinction from one another.</p>

					<p id="expla"><em><b>Regradless of what the society thinks about you, don't you ever doubt your self-worth and value.</b></em> Ignore those bullshit standards and do what you think is best for you. After all, it's your mind, body, and decision. Because in this society where every fish is forced to climb a tree, you can be a fish who decides for itself because <i><b>FISH ain't DUMB</i></b></p>
